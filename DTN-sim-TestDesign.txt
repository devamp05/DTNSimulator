First we have tested the system when nodes were not mobile they just stayed at
the position they were generated. We will add the mobility after this but this
is just a backup so that if mobility doen't work we can submit without it.


decreasing transmission range and desitnation packet count decreased
the amount of packets sent compared to packets received.
The highest factor in receiving playing the destination packet count.
increasing it from 8 to 16 provided 100% transmitting/receiving rate
space left affected the generation time, high value made packets to
wait more to have enough free space to generate.
Transmission range was important with empty space left parameter
as they seemed to balance each other in case of nodes receiving
them.
Timesteps affected possitively when high with high destination
number, increasing the chance that packet will be receiving.
Decreasing buffer resulted in packets getting lost which
decreased the amount of packet being reached to destination
successfully.

1. First test for 1 timestep with around 11 nodes and just 1 destination node.
	200 transmission range, 10 packets buffer space and 20% space to be 
	left for self generated packets.

2. Second test for 2 timesteps with around 11 nodes and just 1 destination 
	node. 200 transmission range, 10 packets buffer space and 20% space to be 
	left for self generated packets.

3. Test for 3 timesteps with around 11 nodes and just 1 destination 
	node. 200 transmission range, 10 packets buffer space and 20% space to be 
	left for self generated packets.

/*how the performance varies by increasing the number of destination nodes*/
4. Test for 3 timesteps with around 11 nodes and 2 destination 
	node. 200 transmission range, 10 packets buffer space and 20% space to be 
	left for self generated packets.


5. Test for 3 timesteps with around 11 nodes and 3 destination 
	node. 200 transmission range, 10 packets buffer space and 20% space to be 
	left for self generated packets.

6. Test for 3 timesteps with around 11 nodes and 5 destination 
	node. 200 transmission range, 10 packets buffer space and 20% space to be 
	left for self generated packets.

7. Test for 4 timesteps with around 14 nodes and 7 destination 
	node. 260 transmission range, 12 packets buffer space and 25% space to be 
	left for self generated packets.

8. Test for 9 timesteps with around 35 nodes and 16 destination 
	node. 160 transmission range, 14 packets buffer space and 20% space to be 
	left for self generated packets.

9. Test for 9 timesteps with around 35 nodes and 16 destination 
	node. 100 transmission range, 14 packets buffer space and 20% space to be 
	left for self generated packets.

10. Test for 9 timesteps with around 20 nodes and 8 destination 
	node. 100 transmission range, 14 packets buffer space and 60% space to be 
	left for self generated packets.


11. Test for 9 timesteps with around 20 nodes and 10 destination 
	node. 100 transmission range, 4 packets buffer space and 60% space to be 
	left for self generated packets.
